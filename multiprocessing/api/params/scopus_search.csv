cursor,,X,This parameter is used when a user wants to execute deep pagination searching (i.e. iterate to the end of a search result set).,,xsd:string,,,,,X,"Under normal circumstances, when using the 'start' parameter (results offset), access to the total result set is limited to a predefined maximum number of results. By using the cursor in place of the 'start' the user can iterate to the very end of the result set, with the restriction that results can only be accessed by iterating forward sequentially (there will be no 'prev' or 'last' links available). This capability is initially accessed by sending a ""*"" in the first search request. Subsequent requests should submit the 'cursor/@next' value from each corresponding response as the 'cursor' value. The 'cursor/@next' value must be URL encoded by the client application. The navigation links ('next') can also be used to navigate to each succeeding search result entry and are URL encoded by default."

Options include na (Modifier name, ascending), fd (Modifier frequency, descending), and fdna (Modifier frequency descending, secondary sort through unity by name, ascending). prefix : filters the facet values to only those matching the prefix specified (not applicable for numeric values). In addition, qualifiers can be specified to include or exclude values from the response (i.e. filter). The options: include : include only the value specified from the facet response. include_above : include only values above the value specified from the facet response. include_below : include only values below the value specified from the facet response. exclude : exclude only the value specified from the facet response. exclude_above : exclude all values above the value specified from the facet response. exclude_below : exclude all values below the value specified from the facet response. ex. facets=authname(count=20,sort=na,prefix=Ma);exactsrctitle (prefix=J);subjarea(sort=fd);pubyear;srctype(sort=fdna)"
